Mesquite calling R
============================================
Mac OS X: 


PREPARING MESQUITE

1. insert libjri.jnilib into Mesquite_Folder/lib/


2.  the directory R with modules needs to be in Mesquite_Folder/mesquite

3. the directory rosuda needs to be in Mesquite_Folder/org

4. There are two ways that might work to run Mesquite, the quick and dirty, and the elegant.

(a) Quick & Dirty:  Copy mesquiteForRMLink.command into your Mesquite_Folder.  Double click it.  It should start Mesquite, a copy from which you can
communicate with R.  If it doesn't start, it may have lost its clue to be executable.

(b) Elegant:  With this you can run R from the double-clickable Mesquite application bundle (the one with the icon).

You need to have a file called "environment.plist" in a directory called ".MacOSX" in your home directory, with the contents:


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist SYSTEM "file://localhost/System/Library/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>R_HOME</key>
	<string>/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources</string>
</dict>
</plist>


If you have this file already, you need to add the two lines beginning with <key> and <string>.  
To discover if you have the file, in the Finder choose Go>Go To Folder and enter ~/.MacOSX  If you have the environment.plist file, 
it will be shown to you.  Otherwise you'll get the message "Folder cannot be found".

If you don't have this directory and file already, you need to make it.  How to make this directory and file?

GEEK-STYLE: from the terminal use mkdir .MacOSX to make the directory, cd into it, then use vi to make the file.
NONGEEK-STYLE: open TextWrangler, and paste the XML into the window.  Request to Save the file, and choose "New Folder", 
and enter ".MacOSX" as the name of the folder. Save the file as "environment.plist".



PREPARING R

Download and install R from http://cran.r-project.org/.  You'll want the GUI version.

Start up the GUI for R (it's called R and is in Applications).  
Go to the menu Packages & Data, and select Package Installer.  
From the Repository CRAN (binaries) ask to get the list.  
Install ape, diversitree, geiger, apTreeshape and any others.  
MAKE SURE "install dependencies" is checked before you hit Install Selected.

RUNNING MESQUITE TO CALL R

If you are using the quick and dirty way to start Mesquite, double click mesquiteForR.command.  
Otherwise, start Mesquite normally by double clicking the application within Mesquite_Folder.  

============================================

Windows:

PREPARING MESQUITE

1. insert jri.dll into Mesquite_Folder/lib/


2. place mesquiteForR.bat into Mesquite_Folder.

3.  the directory R with modules needs to be in Mesquite_Folder/mesquite

4. the directory rosuda needs to be in Mesquite_Folder/org

RUNNING MESQUITE TO CALL R

Start Mesquite by double clicking mesquiteForR.bat within Mesquite_Folder.  
A simple test that the calls to R are working is to open a tree window, and show a tree with branch lengths
defined and with branches drawn proportional to length.  Then choose Alter/Transform Branch Lengths>NPRS.
A dialog box should appear and when you say OK, it should modify the tree's branch lengths.

If it does not seem to work (e.g. Mesquite crashes or hangs), one possible problem is that the path to R
is not properly indicated in the first line of the file mesquiteForRMLink.bat. If needed, edit the path there.

For R 2.7.0, this should be the first line of the batch file:
set PATH=%PATH%;C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-27~1.0\bin;C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-27~1.0\lib

For R 2.6.1,this is the first line
set PATH=%PATH%;C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-26~1.1\bin;C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-26~1.1\lib
